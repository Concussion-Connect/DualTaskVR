# Dual Task VR

DualTask VR is the Node webapp for the Athlete side of the Dual Task Virtual Reality test

After each video has run its course, it will automatically move on to the next phase of the test. In the future, this webapp should be paired with the Athletic Trainer's Android application so the flow of the test can be controlled from the Atletic Trainer's device.

To Run:
1. Download and install the latest stable (LTS) version of Node.js and NPM [here](https://nodejs.dev/)
1. In a command line (typically Terminal on MacOS, cmd or Powershell on Windows), navigate to this project directory
1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
1. Run the app with `node server.js`
1. Message should read "Example app listening on port 3000!"
1. Open any web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to start the app
